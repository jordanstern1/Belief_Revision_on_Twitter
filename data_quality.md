| 128   | @Benigma2017 @JonathanEGreig @ProgDownTicket @AriMelber @JoyAnnReid I used to listen to Bernie every Friday for years - then he wanted to oust the first black president and fill the seat with a white guy.One of the reasons Sanders lost the black vote by 30 points.

| 183   | I never used to like political podcasts but @JustinRYoung changed my mind.  I love his approach to discussing politics which is why I make sure to support him at a level that I get the extra political episodes.  Im glad his @Patreon is doing well. https://t.co/99FWzNL0idSeen a big increase in new Patrons and adjustments to the $3 a week level. Presumably to get the Monday and Friday mini Politics eps.
